Code for this project is located at https://github.com/orcas333/cs7641/tree/master/hw2

To run the code, first set up Jython 2.7: https://www.jython.org/ All code needs to be run using jython.

To generate results for the analysis of algorithm performance on each of the three optimization problems, run each python files respectively (count_ones.py, four_peaks.py, and knapsack.py) for each problem.

To generate results for the neural network with RO algorithms, run NN_GA.py, NN_RHC.py, or NN_SA.py respectively.

Controls for each script are contained in the “__main__” section. Output for each script will be dumped into the /outputs folder.
